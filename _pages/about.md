I am an Associate Professor in the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/index.html) at Texas A&M University. I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Purdue University and my B.S. in Computer Science from the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology. I am a recipient of the DOE Early Career Award and the NSF CAREER Award.

Research Interests
======
My primary area of research is high-performance computing, with a focus on developing parallel algorithms and software to solve large-scale problems in science and engineering. In particular, my work centers on graph and sparse matrix algorithms, with applications in scientific computing, machine learning, and bioinformatics. My research has been supported by the NSF, DOE, and IARPA.

Research Group
======
Working with energetic and innovative students is one of my main motivations for being in academia. More than 10 Ph.D. students have worked with me, and recent graduates have joined institutions and organizations such as Meta, Amazon, Cornell University, Wake Forest University, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. I have also supervised over 20 M.S. students and several undergraduates on various research projects. If you are interested in joining our group, please see the Prospective Students tab for more information. **Prospective students, please read [this](prospective.md)**.
